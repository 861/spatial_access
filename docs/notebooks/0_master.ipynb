    "The purpose of this report is threefold: present the comprehensive methodology for efficiently estimating travel time network distances, generating useful metrics, and illustrating its usage. Specifically, we create an open-source backend infrastructure for estimating travel time network distances (walking and driving), providing the framework for calculating **access** and **coverage** metrics. These two metrics address both the demand and supply of services and goods. On the one hand, the access score focuses on the attributes of the **origins** while on the other, the coverage score focuses on the attributes from the **destinations** of interest. Moreover, this framework allows subsetting of the data according to the user's specific questions of interest. These analyses create a powerful tool for supporting stakeholders and researchers in improving transparent decision-making processes and in understanding the issues of unequal spatial access.\n",

    "Generating large shortest path matrices for different transit types is an important tool for spatial data science, but does not currently have a solution that is open source, highly scalable and efficient. Several tools currently exist which fill a similar purpose to this software package. OSRM, Valhalla, Graphhopper and Google Maps, among other services, offer matrix APIs to compute the shortest path distance for datasets but the open-source solutions break down when applied to very large datasets. On the one hand, both Graphhopper and GoogleMaps charge for the service. On the other hand, creating a pgRouting, OSRM, and Valhalla solution does not properly scale. Lastly, OpenTripPlanner does scale, but it is not as fast as p2p.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the above services caps the number of entries in a request at 25-50, meaning that generating a matrix with 500,000 rows requires breaking the original matrix into millions of submatrices and making millions of individual queries. This approach works well for small datasets, but includes substantial overhead which is prohibitive on a large scale. The point to point shortest path algorithm (p2p) can generate matrices between a set of origin and destination points (or origins-origins) in 2 lines of code, efficiently and with a low memory footprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code generates a driving shortest path matrix for 46,251 blocks in Chicago in ~14 minutes (18 minutes for walking) whereas the same task took > 18 hours using MapZen's Valhalla. For this particular dataset, the mean difference between time values for the driving shortest path matrix and Google Maps' Matrix API is 2 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrices**  \n",
    "Specifically, there are two routes the user can take for getting the travel distances: Creating **asymmetric** or **symmetric** matrices. Symmetric matrices are estimated origin to origin, while asymmetric matrices calculate origin to destination. The user can generate a symmetric distance travel matrix and snap the points of interest to the matrix or create an asymmetric distance matrix that already incorporates origin and destination. The symmetric approach is more appropriate when you need to calculate several scores (across years or different types of scores) for the same area and at the same level of analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics**  \n",
    "After obtaining the distance travel times from origins to destinations (in this case, from the centroids of tracts to the health facilities), the user can calculate the  **access score** from each tract areal unit to health facilities, the time to **closest destinations** (nearest neighbor), the **count of nearby destinations** within a buffer, the **sum of an attribute** of nearby destinations (wthin a community area), the destination's **coverage score** (per capita spending within a buffer), and the amount of per capita spending each tract areal unit has access to using a **Two Stage Floating Catchment Area** method.\n"

The complexity of the network depends on the number of nodes on the generated bounding box (i.e. the area of interest defined by the latitude and longitude coordinates). Therefore, the number of observations should not affect the efficiency of the running times. In order to get the distances from OSM, OSM net calculates the distances of the relations, creating the edges that are queried for the travel time estimation. To estimate these distances, the user has to specify data into a WGS 84 projection. (Please find more specifics in the [requirements file](./docs/notebooks/reqs.ipynb).)  "

Therefore, P2P also uses an adjacency list representation for Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path for every node to every other node in the underlying OSM network, but it can skip doing any processing for nodes that do not have an attached origin data point. The advantage of this approach is that it scales to essentially any size dataset; as opposed to the adjacency matrix representation (which can easily exceed the memory of many systems for reasonably large datasets) P2P never loads the entire network into memory at one time, meaning the memory footprint is relatively small. This also means the multithreaded performance of P2P greatly outperforms the singlethreaded performance.  \n",

In graph theory, strong connectivity means that a path exists between any pair of nodes.

However, the weights can be specified according to each user's needs. Moreover, the dictionary categorizes the second nearest clinic as having less weight than the first one. The user may not care for having a greater number of counts per category. The density weights will create a larger score for areas that have a greater variety of categories, creating a more diverse environment. The variety of categories penalizes areas that have the same type of category within an area. Nevertheless, in some cases (like the Chicago health facilities), the repetition of categories should not be penalized because the demand for those services (hospitals) is higher than the service's provision capacity. Therefore, in this example we categorize as equally important the nearest hospital as the fifth nearest hospital. If there is a sixth hospital within a 30 minute buffer of a tract, the score will neglect it since there are only 5 weights specified under 'Hospitals'. As we mentioned before, in this particular case, the dictionary will only take into account the destinations (health facilities) that are within a 30 minute network distance buffer.
